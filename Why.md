I think the most exciting part of machine learning is that it can tell the reason from the result. My PhD research is about the machine leanring application in coastal hazard mitigation. During my PhD life, I was impression about its powerful.

I think one of my drawback is the product sense. From my research about job market, companines require data scientists using machine learning methods to analyz data in order to imporve the product. For me, I am very confident about my technic skills like machine learning algorithms. But I am lacking in product view.
